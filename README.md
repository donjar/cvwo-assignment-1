# Execution Plan

Currently I only have the registration and login forms set up; I just learned PHP, SQL and mysqli. I plan to add:
* E-mail verification (optional, but I'll try my best)
* Actual blog functionality (of course)
* CSS styling (need to learn CSS first tho)
* Javascript (I'm not sure where I use this? Seems PHP can handle that already? I'll try find by myself)
* Markdown support on blog posts (very optional)
These also depends on how much time I have on my holidays (of course).
I have a database diagram and pages flow diagram set up in my home but I'm still in vacation >.<

Also I'm not sure if what I submit is correct. Please give feedback, I'm new to these...
